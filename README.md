CBANK is a monorepo containing a collection of Claude Skills purpose-built for financial services workflows, plus a Next.js 14 showcase site. Each skill is a standalone `SKILL.md` file — upload the ZIP to `claude.ai/customize/skills` and it becomes a slash command available to your entire Claude workspace. No API keys. No infrastructure. No code required.

---

## What it does

- **Institutional-grade models** — Claude reads 10-Ks, analyst reports, and data rooms to build DCF, LBO, comps, and 3-statement models in Excel
- **Pitch deck automation** — CIMs, IC memos, morning notes, and financial plans drafted in hours instead of days
- **Desk-specific workflows** — 7 verticals each targeting a specific financial desk, from IB pitch books to fund admin NAV tie-outs
- **Zero dependencies** — each skill is a plain markdown file; no API wiring, no integrations required beyond a Claude for Work account
- **Open source** — Apache-2.0 licensed; fork and customize SKILL.md files to match your firm's templates and terminology
